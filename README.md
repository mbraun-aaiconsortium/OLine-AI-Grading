🏈 Football AI Grading Platform
This project uses computer vision (YOLOv8-Pose) to automatically analyze football practice film frame-by-frame, grading offensive linemen based on coach-defined technical criteria.

Core Features:
Detects players & pose keypoints from video footage.

Detects ball snap timing to mark play start.

Classifies play type (Run / Pass) and specific run plays.

Grades each offensive lineman's first & second step (placement, direction, timing).

Tracks OL body positioning every 0.5s post-snap.

Detects technical errors (e.g., slow step, pad level too high).

Generates annotated video with overlays.

Exports grading reports in CSV format for coaches.
